# Web/Lua & a bit of Python developer that makes stuff
## I make stuff
I try to publish random experiments on GitHub for everyone to see and reuse.

## I own websites
Look @ my organisations

## Programming Languages
* PHP
* JavaScript
* Lua
* (a bit of) Python

## I write bios way too seriously
Maybe I should. Maybe I shouldn't.
